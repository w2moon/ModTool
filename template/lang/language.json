  "DIALOG_STORY4_GIRL4": "This machine can control the portal, which can transport you to places where you will find those. Enter this portal, sacrifice those creatures, and in exchange, i will grant you the help that you need.",
  "DIALOG_STORY5_GIRL1": "I can feel the soul of that monster... try it.",
  "DIALOG_STORY5_GIRL2": "There is some kind of power... some kind of power that made that perfectly normal girl, to big and strong monstrosity...",
  "DIALOG_STORY5_GIRL3": "Well whatever, it doesn't matter. We got what we came for. Now, take its stomach and lets do the secrifice.",
  "DIALOG_STORY6_GIRL1": "Looks like there are more people here now. It seems that basement is breathing with life once again. Well, come with me.",
  "DIALOG_STORY6_GIRL2": "Put its stomach into this tank, it will do the job.",
  "DIALOG_STORY6_GIRL3": "The first secret! Nice... well umm... pick it up.",
  "DIALOG_STORY6_GIRL4": "Ehh, its useless. We need something else. Let's go for hunting once more. Hunting for another strong monster like this one. And now it should be easier with that new, more powerful and fresh body of yours.",
  "DIALOG_STORY7_professor1": "You have met before someone who love to sleep on the ground as well? Well, i'm just too old to resist sleeping on the ground like this when i'm tired.",
  "DIALOG_STORY7_professor2": "The most powerful monsters? I know place, where one of them is.",
  "DIALOG_STORY7_professor3": "But young one, haven't you forgotten about something? Maybe you will take a look at this first?",
  "DIALOG_STORY7_professor4": "Be careful young man, you can use the power of a monster, can have body of a monster, but do not let your soul become a soul of a monster too. But funny how things come, that i found this bear beside one of them, the most powerful ones.",
  "DIALOG_STORY7_role1": "Who's there? Is it yet another person lying on the ground? Like that girl before..",
  "DIALOG_STORY7_role2": "No, She is not like you.. Well anyway, i'm looking for the most powerful monsters on this island, do you know anything that can be helpful?",
  "DIALOG_STORY7_role3": "Huh?! It's from my sister! I... i came to this island to find my sister!",
  "DIALOG_STORY7_role4": "So hunt for bodies of a monsters and looking for my sister will be the same thing? It's really great, i can do both of this things combined! ",
  "DIALOG_STORY8_girl1": "Wow, your body is really charming now. Have you found the most powerful monster yet?",
  "DIALOG_STORY8_girl2": "Fine by me. And remember my words that if your sister wouldn't be there, i can help you with finding her.",
  "DIALOG_STORY8_role1": "I know the place where one of them can be. Also my sister may be there too.",
  "DIALOG_STORY9_girl1": "Another of those powerful ones down, great!",
  "DIALOG_STORY9_girl2": "This one, before he became a monster, really loved to watch TV wasn't he?",
